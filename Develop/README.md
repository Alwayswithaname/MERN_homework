    ## Description
    
    this project was to transition a website to using a graphQL API using the Apollo server, I got the signup and login functioning but couldnt get the save book function working, resived errors and invalid token, I started on the final project and updated my node becuase a teammate was runnning a more resent virsion and now cant do much with this project without downgrading.
